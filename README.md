ANTS2 is a simulation and experimental data processing package for Anger camera-type detectors. The package is intended for:

+ Optimization of detector design and geometry using Monte Carlo simulations
+ Optimization and development of event reconstruction techniques
+ Adaptive (iterative) reconstruction of response of light sensors using flood field illumination data
+ Reconstruction and filtering of events for experimental data

It is an open source and multiplatform package, developed using CERN ROOT and Qt framework (C++).
